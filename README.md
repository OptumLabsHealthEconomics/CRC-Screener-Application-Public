# CRC-Screener-Application-Public

The python file contained here contains an incomplete re-implementation of the CRC-AIM model. There are a number of components that have not been implemented or are incomplete, including but not limited to
* Treatment/care costs for cancer
* Colonoscopy complications
* Screening (incomplete)

This is not yet a finished tool. Inputs are all hard-coded, scenarios/pathways limited, and some assumptions differ from those of CRC-AIM. 
We understand that the infrastructure for screening and surveillance is far from complete (and is bug-ridden). 
Largely we are seeking feedback on the natural history components of CRC-AIM before we move further along in building the screening overlays. 
The things that we are not sure about are described in the comments and are clearly marked by "NOTE". 
Additionally, each function that contains a question also has "NOTE" written in a comment just preceding the function definition. 
Any questions or comments without "NOTE" before them are not ones for which we are soliciting answers/feedback.
