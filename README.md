# CRC-Screener-Application-Public

The python file in this repository contains the OptumLabs V1 re-implementation of the CRC-AIM model.  This code is implemented at https://crc-screener-microsimulation.optumlabs.com/

This version is our first best effort to faithfully implement the CRC-AIM model.  The specifications of this model can be found in these papers:
